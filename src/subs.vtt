00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:22.066
My mind won't let me rest

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.500
Voice in my head

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.300
I hear what it said

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.400
I can't trust a thing

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:32.333
If I picked up and left

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:36.266
How fast would you forget

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.300
Resting while I'm inside
your presence

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.166
I don't want to
think nothing bad

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:51.100
This time I won't,
this time I won't

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.566
5Am when I walked in

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.333
Could not
believe what I saw, yeah

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.233
You on another one's body

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.600
Ghosts of the
past came to haunt me

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:06.266
I caught you but
you never caught me

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.700
I was sitting
here waitin on karma

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.233
There goes my
guilty conscience

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.433
There goes my
guilty conscience

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.100
5Am when I walked in

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.566
Could not believe what I saw,
yeah

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.333
You on another one's body

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.133
Ghosts of the
past came to haunt me

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.466
I caught you but
you never caught me

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.233
I was sitting
here waitin on karma

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.533
There goes my
guilty conscience

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.266
There goes my
guilty conscience

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.166
No I won't, let you stay

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.300
Thanks for the hours

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.300
Thanks for the days

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:47.433
If I see your eyes

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.400
I turn to stone

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.366
I look away

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.566
I got to go

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.433
Gone for the week,
don't bother

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:02.233
Til pigs fly
she'll keep on calling

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.600
I've been working for me,
not sorry

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.500
Next time that we speak,
I'll be calm

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:10.200
Next time that I go in,
I'm all in

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.600
Why you so close
but you feel so far

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.433
You look like the
moon in the morning

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:18.666
Jaded, faded, almost gone

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:24.333
Resting while I'm inside
your presence

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:30.200
I don't wanna
think nothing bad

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:34.433
Goodnights are never
really good nights

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:39.766
Feel something
that's heavy inside

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.400
5Am when I walked in

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.133
Could not believe what I saw,
yeah

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:47.566
You on another one's body

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.433
Ghosts of the
past get to haunt me

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:52.766
I caught you but
you never caught me

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.566
I was sitting
here waitin on karma

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.733
There goes my
guilty conscience

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:01.200
There goes my
guilty conscience

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:03.566
5Am when I walked in

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.400
Could not believe what I saw,
yeah

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:09.233
You on another one's body

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.633
Ghosts of the
past get to haunt me

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:14.333
I caught you but
you never caught me

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:16.733
I was sitting
here waitin on karma

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.400
There goes my
guilty conscience

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:21.666
There goes my
guilty conscience
